The clash happened between two adjacent villages who disagreed upon land issues. A large mound of skeletons was discovered from the cave which belonged to the warriors who lost their lives in the war. These remnants have still been preserved inside the cave along with the artillery used in the war. The Lamsial Puk cave is the evidence of bravery and heroism as well as of the atrocities and horrors of war. It is this very aspect associated with the cave that calls out to tourists from far-off places. Best way to get to the cave is by taking the bus or a private car from Aizawl to Farkawn (total distance 92 kilometres) or take a flight to the Lengui Airport in Aizawl from any of the metro cities in India</p>
